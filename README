Python/c++/ctypes -test

This project implements a simple shared library exposing a C-style simple
API. Behind the API there is a c++ class implementation which acts
according to the requests made to the API.

Single project Makefile builds the lib, and a unit test case in C for the
solution. There exists also a python counterpart for the unit test.

Finally, run.sh shell script runs both unit test, which are supposed to
build similar results, of course.

The example was written since I could not find a complete example of
doing such a thing in the wild. It was open sources, since someone else
might find the same mechanism useful in the shape of an example.

Requirements for building this package are (on linux platform)
- python-ctypes and python-ctypeslib packages (from repository.

Tested with Ubuntu 11.10 (64-bit)
